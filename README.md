# Soybean-Yield-Prediction

This project explores the use of remote sensing data, specifically satellite images, and CNN-LSTM models with Gaussian Process in predicting annual crop yield.

It builds upon and compares to the work proposed by Jiaxuan You et al. in Deep Gaussian Process for Crop Yield Prediction Based on Remote Sensing Data, available at: https://github.com/JiaxuanYou/crop_yield_prediction.
